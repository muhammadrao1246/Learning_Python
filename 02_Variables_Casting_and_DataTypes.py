# a variable will be created when the a value is  assigned to it

#scope is mandatory as local and global scope matters

#there are many variable types built in supported in the python programming language


# INITIALIZING VARIABLES 
## One method to assign single value to a single variable
a = 10

## One another method is to initailize a single value to multiple variables
a = b = c = "SAAAAAAA"  # overrides the other assignment values and datatypes

## Another method is to assign multiple values to multiple variables at the same time
a , b, c = 10 , 10.5353, "CCCCC"  #must follow the order to assign values to variables appropriately


# VARIABLES DATA TYPES SUPPORTED

## integer
int_var = 10000000000009999999999999999999999999
int_var = -11

## casting a another datatype to integer directly to preserve the int datatype
int_var = int("123")
int_var = int(10.241)
int_var = int('65')

## float or double

float_var = 21.4
float_var = -342.123212412412

float_var = float(2112.523)
float_var = float("442.3311")

## string
string_var = "iam  a text string"

string_var = str(10.4124)
string_var = str(3242)


## complex is also supportedd

com = 1321j


## bool
is_bool_supported = True | False
